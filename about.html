      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p> I was born in France, grew up in Africa and went to college in Paris. I knew I wanted to be a journalist in the U.S., so I got a bilingual job at the UN headquarters in New York and eventually made my way to Columbia journalism school. </p>
      <p> For many years after that, my world was all about journalism: I was a technology reporter at Reuters, writing about Samsung and Apple's business ties, then a news editor at Bloomberg, publishing stories about Putin's billionaire friends. </p>
      <p> But... </p>
      <p>every year I found myself increasingly drawn to the other side of my industry: the technology that was powering the financial databases and news terminals.
      <p>So I rolled up my (mental) sleeves, stalked all kinds of tech meetups, and started down the road to coding.
      <p>The most important lesson: Learning to code is HARD -- and such a joy! Over the past few years I've taught myself some JavaScript, including some React.js, Node.js, Express.js; Git/GitHub; some SQL and Python. So much to learn, so little time....</p>
